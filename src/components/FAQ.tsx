      question: "Can I use slides, props, pictures, or music in my video?",
      answer: "No â€“ videos should be unedited and feature only your voice and presence. No slides, props, pictures, background music, or special effects are allowed as the speech is designed to be short and impactful, showcasing your natural speaking ability."

    },
    {
      question: "What should I wear in my video?",
